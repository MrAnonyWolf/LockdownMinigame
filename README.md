# LockdownMinigame


This is just a minigame made using shell but you need to find the vulnerability to unlock your GNU from the script
It's a bit tricky and annoying but you are unable to exit or using ctrl+c while playing with the script but that being said, it is still possible to escape. ***Warning*** **Play with your own risk if you are new to this.**

**How to use**
there will be 2 difficulties.

● the easy difficulty use the *sh* command to open

***example***

*sh lock.sh*

● the hard difficulty use the *bash* or *./* commands to open

***example***

*bash lock.sh* or *./lock.sh*

The last one is a bit impossible but i know you can do it.
Interested to play? why not! try now and play with your own risk!
