# LockdownMinigame
Just a minigame but you need to find the vulnerability to unlock your GNU from the script
It's a bit tricky and annoying but you are unable to exit or using ctrl+c while playing with the script but that being said, it is still possible to escape. Play with your own risk if you are new to this
